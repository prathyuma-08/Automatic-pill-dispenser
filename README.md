## Automatic Pill Dispenser 

Our project introduces an exciting Automatic Pill Dispenser (APD) enriched with an array of additional features in its accompanying app. Failure to take pills on time can lead to a cascade of adverse effects. The simple act of taking pills as prescribed holds immense significance in safeguarding a patient’s health and quality of life. We recognize the challenges faced by individuals and caregivers alike in maintaining consistent medication routines.


### Objectives

●	To have a reliable dispense of medications at scheduled times, reducing the risk of missed doses.

●	To personalize medication schedules within the app, accommodating the unique needs and preferences of each individual.

●	To create an intuitive and user-friendly app interface that complements the APD, making it easy for users not just to set up medication schedules and also provide reminders for general health-related activities.

●	To optimize the process to maintain low production costs while ensuring the quality and reliability of the APD
